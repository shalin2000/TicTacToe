The source code for this program is located in the src folder. You will need to go to that directory to compile and run. javac AI_MinMax.java and then java AI_MinMax

Input:
The input to this program is a string of the format specified in the write up. A 'b' denotes a blank space and a capital X or capital O represent what they are. Proper input is required to run this program, there is not a lot of error checking as the program this would be in would not need to ( a tic tac toe game with a computer opponent). 

Output:
This program assumes, as in the write up, that it will be X's turn to move. The program prints out the initial states that can be made from X's next move. It also prints out a min/max value for the resulting state. A value of -1 means it did not result in a win, A 10 is a win for X, a -10 is a win for O and a 0 is a tie.
The last line of output will list all the moves that X should make
